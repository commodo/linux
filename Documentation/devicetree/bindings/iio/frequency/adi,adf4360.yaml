  Bindings for the Analog Devices ADF4360 family of clock generator phase-locked
  loop (PLL) devices with an integrated voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).
  Each of the parts in the family supports a specific frequency range.

  adi,loop-filter-charger-pump-current-microamp:
    description: |
      The charge pump current that the external loop filter was designed for.
      The provided value is clamped to the closest enumerated value.
    enum: [ 310, 620, 930, 1250, 1560, 1870, 2180, 2500 ]

  adi,vco-minimum-frequency-hz:
    description: |
      Required for ADF4360-7, ADF4360-8 and ADF4360-9. Minimum VCO frequency
      that can be supported by the tuning range set by the external inductor.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,vco-maximum-frequency-hz:
    description: |
      Required for ADF4360-7, ADF4360-8 and ADF4360-9. Maximum VCO frequency
      that can be supported by the tuning range set by the external inductor.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,loop-filter-inverting:
    description: Indicates that the external loop filter is an inverting filter.
    type: boolean

  adi,power-up-frequency-hz:
    description: |
      PLL tunes to the set frequency on probe or defaults to either the minimum
      for the part or value set using adi,vco-minimum-frequency-hz.
    maxItems: 1

  vdd-supply:
    description: |
      vdd supply is used to enable or disable chip when regulator power down
      mode is set. Other power down modes are used to mitigate the case of a
      shared regulator.
