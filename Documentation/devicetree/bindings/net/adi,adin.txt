Analog Devices ADIN1200/ADIN1300 PHY bindings

Required properties:
	- reg - The ID number for the phy, usually a small integer

Optional properties:
	- compatible: Compatible list, may contain "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"
		in which case Clause 45 will be used to access device
		management registers. If unspecified, Clause 22 will be used.
		Use this only when MDIO supports Clause 45 access, but there is
		no other way to determine this.

Example:

	ethernet-phy@0 {
		compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45";
		reg = <0>;
	};
